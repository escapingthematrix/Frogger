How to play
=============

Use your arrow keys to move.

The goal is to collect gems.

Each gem gives you 450 points.

If you get hit by an enemy you lose a life.

If you get hit by a floating heart, you will gain a life but lose a gem, losing 450 points.

If you jump in the water you will lose a life but gain a gem back giving you 450 points back.

Once you collect 5 gems and grab the key guardians will appear.  They destroy enemy bugs! For free!

The game ends once your out of lives. You start with 3 lives.
